Description: 
	Accounting and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software packages are widely
	used by various government organizations and business enterprises and external
	and internal auditors. However, due to the inconsistencies in designs,
	interfaces and data contents as well as format, financial, operational and
	management data cannot be swiftly and comprehensively collected by users, such
	as government supervision departments, external and internal auditors.
	This International standard (ISO 21378) aims to resolve the common problems that
	 auditors face when requesting data to perform their audit procedures. This
	standard will help to improve the accessibility and transparency of audit data,
	standardize the process of collecting audit data, avoid duplicated efforts and
	effectively save resources. The standardization of audit data contents and
	format at world-wide level will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of
	government, internal and external audits, and provide benefits to related
	stakeholders.

	this table, the quantity can serve different regulatory and managerial purposes.
	 For example, subledgers of inventory and PPE may not be covered in some
	auditees' systems. In this case, we can record the cumulative total and balance
	of quantity of inventory or PPE in this table. This is a well-established
	practice in some countries, like France and China. Countries can choose to use
	GL_Trial_Balance or GL_Accounts_Period_Balance or both, depending on their

GL ACCOUNT SEGMENT
   Tag: GSG
   Description: 
	Contains the code and name for the account segment, as well as the
	GL_Account_Number to which the account segment is related. Account Segment
	provides additional information for particular GL_Accounts (e.g. the AR contains
	 the information regarding supplier, customer, employee, and project). Such
	information would be treated as an Account Segment below A/R, thus resulting in
	a lengthy account structure. The Account Segment structure is therefore defined
	as a set to record related information, which efficiently stops account names
	and numbers from becoming too long and too complex. Account Segment is more
	flexible to capture the complicated information.
	Some of the most frequently used account segments (e.g. project, employee, bank
	account) are defined as fixed fields in tables, such as GL_Details. These
	segments are called "fixed account segments" in the document. Fixed account
	segments and other customized account segments are covered in this table.
